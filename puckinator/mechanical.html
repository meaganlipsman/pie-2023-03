                            <span width="400">We used NEMA 23 stepper motors for our arm mechanism, but these motors
                                did
                                not produce
                                enough
                                torque for our needs. This required a gearbox for our motors. We have a 3:1 gearbox
                                ratio
                                using 3D printed PETG herringbone gears. Herringbone gears can carry more load than
                                standard gears. Since we wanted to be able to print our gears, it was crucial that
                                we
                                achieved a strong gear. To reduce friction
                                with
                                our shaft, we have shoulder bearings at each plate interface for our gearbox. Our
                                shafts
                                are 6061 aluminum that have a threaded hole for the large gear interface and arms
                                are
                                attached using a set screw. Our smaller gears are mounted to our stepper motors
                                using
                                have of a spider coupling. We used a press fit with a spider coupling to allow us to
                                clamp to the shaft of the stepper motor. Our gearbox has one inch of clearance
                                between
                                the plates, maintained by 1 in alumnium standoffs fabricated from 3/8” 6061 aluminum
                                rod stock. We use 1/4-20” bolts to constrain our gearbox.

                            <span width="400">We decided to design a parallel SCARA arm to move the striker across
                                the
                                table. This arm uses two
                                NEMA 23 stepper motors and can move along two axes. The arm interfaces with the output
                                shafts of
                                the
                                gearbox
                                using a set screw. The joint between the arms contains a ball bearing and a thrust
                                bearing. The
                                ball bearing reduces the friction between the arms and the thrust bearing absorbs axial
                                loads on the
                                joint. This is all retained using tapped piece of aluminum with a bolt through it.
                                Mounted to our
                                gearbox are two limit switches. These allow us to home our arm so we are referencing
                                from the same
                                starting point at the beginning of each game.

                <h5>Camera Mount</h5>
                <p class="indent">
                    To track the location of the puck throughout gameplay, we used a camera mounted above the air hockey
                    table. We used a wooden frame to achieve the height to view the entire play surface. The wooden
                    frame interfaces with two 3D printed pieces that sit under the edge of the table, securing the
                    stand. The camera slots into a 3D printed piece mounted at the top of the wooden frame.
