			<h4>Stepper Motors and Motor Drivers Wiring</h4>
			<p class="indent">Our Main Electrical System involved 2 stepper motors that each interfaced with their
				own motor
				drivers and an Arduino Uno. We used 1.26 Nm Nema 23 stepper motors (rated 2.8/4.2 amps) and
				TB6600
				Stepper Motor Drivers (rated for 4 amps and 9-42 volts). We chose these specific motors because
				they
				would supply enough torque to move our arm as quickly as we needed to. Additionally, we chose
				the
				TB6600 Stepper Motor Drivers because it matched the amps that our motors needed. </p>

			<p class="indent">
				The stepper drivers connected to the stepper motors, our DC power supply, and our Arduino in the
				following ways:
			</p>
			<h6 style="text-align: left;">How it's connected to the motors: </h6>
			<p class="indent">
				Our stepper motors were 4 wire motors so each wire is connected to an end of one of the coils inside the
				motor. This means that there were two pairs of wires: A+ and A- which were connected to one of the
				coils, and B+ and B- which were connected to the other coil. Through research and testing, we determined
				that the red and blue wires and the black and green wires were paired. These pairs, respectively, were
				wired directly to the A+, A-, B+, and B- spots on the stepper driver.

			<h6 style="text-align: left;">How it's connected to the DC power supply: </h6>
			<p class="indent">
				The stepper drivers were powered by an external AC to DC power supply. The VCC and GND spots on the
				stepper drivers were connected to separate power and ground ports on the power supply. The power supply
				was set so that each stepper driver could receive 18 volts and about 4 amps.

			<br>
			<h6 style="text-align: left;">How it's connected to the Arduino: </h6>
			<p class="indent">
				Finally, we chose to use an Arduino Uno to control the enable, direction, and pulse(step) pins on the
				stepper driver. To ensure that all of the grounds were the same, we connected the ENA-, DIR-, and PUL-
				to the ground of the Arduino. ENA+, DIR+, and PUL+ for both motor drivers needed to be connected to
				digital pins on the Arduino. PUL+, DIR +, ENA+ for stepper driver 1 were connected to Arduino pins D5,
				D6, and D7 respectively. PUL+, DIR +, ENA+ for stepper driver 2 were connected to Arduino pins D8, D9,
				and D10 respectively. To prevent accidental disconnects, we soldered each wire to header pins we plugged
				into the Arduino.

			<h4>Homing Limit Switches and E-Stop</h4>
			<p class="indent">We incorporated 2 end stops into our project so that we could home our stepper motors. We
				used limit switches as our end stops. Both end stop switches had power and ground that were connected to
				the power and ground from the Arduino. The signal lines for both end stop switches needed to be
				connected to digital pins of the Arduino. As such, the signal line for end stop switch 1 and 2 were
				connected to digital pins D11 and D12 respectively.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img width="800" src="images/End Stop Switches.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align: middle;">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="indent">We also added an E-stop so that we could stop all movement of the arm should something go
				wrong. For this
				we used a large red push button and connected it an interrupt pin on the Arduino. The interrupt pin we
				used was digital pin D2, which we connected to one side of the button while grounding the other side.
