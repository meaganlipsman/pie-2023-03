                  Our team aimed to create a robotic air hockey player. We were
                  excited about the concept of creating a fun, interactive
                  project and decided air hockey was the perfect game. Our main
                  objectives were to create a final project that:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  1. Made us proud as a team - i.e. a polished final project
                  that works well and is fun to play.
                  <br />
                  2. Was scalable and reasonable for our time frame
                  (approximately 13 weeks) and had a achievable minimum viable
                  product and stretch goals.
                  <br />
                  3. Had enough technical challenges for our individual learning
                  goals
                  <br />
                  4. Allowed us to maintain a healthy teaming dynamic with our
                  fellow classmates.

                    In sprint 1, we completed our most basic MVP of a single 
                    robotic arm that was able to play defense. We started by
                    electrically integrating our stepper motors, stepper
                    drivers, Arduino, camera, and power supply. Using OpenCV in
                    python, we corrected camera distortion and tracked the
                    puckâ€™s location. We sent the location to the Arduino via
                    serial communication. Finally, we wrote arm control firmware
                    in ArduinoIDE to rotate the arm to match the y-position of
                    the puck. Alongside the electrical and software components
                    we also fabricated the first version of our gear box, the
                    single arm, and a prototype camera mount.

                    In sprint 2, we completed our target goal of a parallel
                    SCARA that could play basic defense by matching y-position.
                    The main task for mechanical in this sprint was fabricating
                    the parallel SCARA and new gear boxes. Our main electrical
                    tasks were to wire the second stepper motor and stepper
                    driver into the Arduino and incorporate end stop switches
                    for homing. Additionally, we integrated a better power
                    supply with short circuit protection for safety purposes. On
                    the software side, we calculated the inverse kinematics to
                    be able to control the new arm and integrated this into our
                    current software system. We purchased a new high-frame rate
                    camera and debugged serial communication overflow issues,
                    which led to a significant reduction in latency.

                    In sprint 3, we worked towards our reach goals of trajectory
                    prediction software, robust mounting, and beautification. To
                    achieve this, we calculated the velocity vector of the puck
                    and defined several different modes of behavior depending on
                    whether the puck would bounce, head back towards the player,
                    or head directly towards the robot. We built a better
                    overhead camera mount, attached the two gear boxes together
                    and to the table, integrated an E-stop button, harnessed our
                    cables and created an electrical enclosure.
